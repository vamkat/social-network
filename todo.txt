(UI/UX appealing. Follow good practices)

1. Create-Post component ACCORDING TO CURRENT DESIGN.
2. Create-Comment component ACCORDING TO CURRENT DESIGN.
3. Create-Group component ACCORDING TO CURRENT DESIGN.



============= Stamatis Todos =============

1. Create single post page

2. Post structure has changed. Update mock data, and post cards.
- Currently post cards fetch last comment on hover. Update this.
- Create navigational links with below schema. examples below: 
      /profile/${basicUserInfo.UserID} -> navigates to profile page.
      /profile/LastComment.Creator.UserID -> navigates to profile page.
      /posts/${post.ID} -> navigates to post page.

NumOfHearts should be a button as we will want to triger a reaction on click when ready.
NumOfComments should stay as it is. We dynamically have a button to show comments on hover.
